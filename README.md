### ARDUINO_BASICS

A small project to demonstrate a number of elementary features of the Arduino Uno. The project includes reading and writing to digital pins, reading an analogue value, using a PWM output, and communication via the serial port. Tyere is also a simple moving average class to reduce noise from external sources, and code to interpret the signal from a TMP36 temperature sensor.

This is very basic stuff but still useful to beginnners.

The development environment is PlatformIO.
